    {
      question: "What is The Referee Project?",
      answer: "The Referee Project is a non-profit initiative to create reliability scores for research papers, built on a standardized taxonomy of research weaknesses and a bug bounty mechanism for finding issues."
    },
    {
      question: "How will academic journals react?",
      answer: "We expect journals to be highly sceptical and dismissive at first. Eventually, however, they might even welcome the service Referee provides if they trust the results."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the relationship with existing resources like PubPeer?",
      answer: "Referee intends to leverage many existing projects and tools, such as the comments in PubPeer... The world of commentary on papers is very fragmented today."
    },
    {
      question: "How can a bug bounty approach be effectively applied to complex academic research?",
      answer: "How are these nuanced, non-binary aspects of paper reliability determined today that are so worth protecting? It's determined by individuals likely with widely varying standards."
    },
    {
      question: "How can a single framework accommodate the diversity of academic disciplines?",
      answer: "Central to our approach is the belief that creating a universal standard for evaluating research integrity is only impossible if framed as a question, not a goal."
    },
    {
      question: "Can research quality be represented by a numerical score?",
      answer: "Like any metric, a single reliability score will be flawed and crude. But it will be vastly better than the status quo, where information on flawed papers is widely scattered."
    },
    {
      question: "How will the project prevent system gaming?",
      answer: "No system escapes gaming... We not only expect the Referee system to be gamed, we encourage it. Why? Because adversarial processes strengthen systems."
    },
    {
      question: "How will the project overcome resistance from academic gatekeepers?",
      answer: "We expect some academics to be offended by the Referee project's approach to allow 'non-experts' to pass judgment on their work."
    },
    {
      question: "How will the project address academic resistance to having flaws pointed out?",
      answer: "The question assumes Referee cares about sustaining individual academic career paths and the academic journal industry. We simply don't."
    },
    {
      question: "How effective can AI be in identifying research flaws?",
      answer: "Bug bounties are placed on specific claims, ones that do not require an in-depth understanding of the domain. Modern AI models have blown past the Turing test."
    },
    {
      question: "How will anonymity be managed to prevent abuse?",
      answer: "The source of the bounty claimants is not important. That is a core feature of the system."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I get involved?",
      answer: "Follow updates and opportunities on our X account at @referee_project."
